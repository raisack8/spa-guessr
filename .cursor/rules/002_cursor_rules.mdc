# Cursor Rules Framework

## .mdc File Structure & Best Practices

**File Naming:** `NNN_name.mdc` (NNN = 001-299)
- `001-099`: Core/workspace rules
- `100-199`: Integration rules  
- `200-299`: Pattern rules
- Higher numbers take precedence if rules conflict

## UI Components

### 1. Description (top)
- Brief purpose summary
- Appears in AI context

### 2. Globs (top)  
- Comma-separated list
- Example: `**/*.ts, **/*.tsx, app/**/*`
- Use standard glob syntax

### 3. Body Text
- Keep under 25 lines when possible
- Use concise/shorthand
- Tag files with @
- Focus on key directives

## Best Practice
The assistant may propose changes to .mdc files for the user to copy into the UI. The assistant should not attempt direct file edits to .mdc files.
